      <p>This was my first project for GA. We were meant to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a simple browser game.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/bristolk4/project-1">Project 1</a>
      
      <p>Project 2 required us to use Express/EJS and MongoDB/Mongoose to build a CRUD app, and AWS to deploy it.</p>

      <p>In my third project, we worked in a group to create a CRUD app using Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, Bootstrap, and React.</p>

      <p>For my fourth project, I worked in another group to create another CRUD App, using Python, Django, Postgres, React, Bootstrap, a third party Web API, and authentication.</p>

      <p>My most recent project included a frontend app and a backend app. The frontend app was an app for flashcards with trivia questions using Typescript and React, and the backend app was a typing console game using C#/.NET.</p>
